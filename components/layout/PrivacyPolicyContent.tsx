    </ul>

    <h2 id="legalbases" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></em></p>
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4">
      <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about <a href="#withdrawconsent" className="text-blue-600">withdrawing your consent</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
      <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></strong></p>
    <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can <a href="#withdrawconsent" className="text-blue-600">withdraw your consent</a> at any time.</p>
    <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4">
      <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
      <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
      <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
      <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
      <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
      <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
      <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
      <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
      <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
      <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
      <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
      <li>We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="whoshare" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>
    <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4">
      <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="inforetain" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than one (1) months past the start of the idle period of the user's account.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2 id="infosafe" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</em></p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    <h2 id="infominors" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
    <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to minors.</em></p>
    <p>Minors: Our app is not specifically directed at individuals under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18 without verifiable parental consent. However, we do not restrict access to users based solely on age. If you are under 18, you may use the app only with the involvement and permission of a parent or legal guardian. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a user under 18 without appropriate consent, we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2 id="privacyrights" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</em></p>
    <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section '<a href="#contact" className="text-blue-600">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>' below.</p>
    <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
    <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" className="text-blue-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Member State data protection authority</a> or <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/" className="text-blue-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK data protection authority</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="withdrawconsent" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Withdrawing your consent</h3>
    <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section '<a href="#contact" className="text-blue-600">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>' below.</p>
    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Account Information</h3>
    <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4">
      <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at support@adulting-app.co.</p>

    <h2 id="DNT" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
    <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>

    <h2 id="uslaws" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
